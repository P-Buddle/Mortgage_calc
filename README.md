# Mortgage_calc
Mortgage calculate GUI

My first attempt at writing my own program NOT from a tutorial.
I created this whilst I was in the process of buying a house and needed a more efficient way of comparing mortgage options.

I wanted a series of inputs that would output the overall payment of the mortgage period, and allow comparisons.
The program was successful and greatly reduced the time and effort of working things out manually with a calculator or pen and paper. 

I created tkinter GUI in order to leave the console, and create a physical app. 
Although not very attractive, the prospect of creating a program that could exist outside of an IDE was exciting. 

I intend to create an .exe file for this at some point, although I will likely have revised the code entirely to make it run more efficiently and look better.
